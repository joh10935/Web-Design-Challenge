# Web-Design-Challenge

## Background
Create a website by using visualizations that were created using the weather data provided.

- Build a dashboard, create individual pages for each plot and a way to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations. A landing page will provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them.
